# Rainbowgum 

An opinionated small logging framework that does mostly what you want OOB.

It is called rainbowgum after https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eucalyptus_deglupta


* It does the right thing OOB like using JAnsi for colors
* It starts much faster than logback and log4j (1/2)
* It focuses on being programmatically configurable.
* It has zero dependencies (unless using the slf4j bridge)
* It is modularized
