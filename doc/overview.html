<h2 id="description">Description</h2>

Rainbow Gum is a modern opinionated SLF4J implementation that aims to be easier to use
while leveraging newer JDK technology.

Rainbow Gum unlike Logback or Log4J (2) does not offer as much flexibility but is simpler
and has less overhead.

The readme in the Rainbow Gum project discusses more extensively on the design and philosophy.

<h3 id="requirements">Requirements</h3>

<ol>
  <li><a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/">Java 21 or greater</a></li>
  <li>A build system that supports running the Java compiler annotation processor</li>
</ol>

The only module needed during runtime is  
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/module-summary.html">
  <code>java.base</code>
</a>

<h3 id="limitations">Limitations</h3>

Currently Rainbowgum does not provide support for:

<ul>
  <li>External config - by design you will need to bring your own configuration lib or just use env/system properties</li>
  <li>Rolling of log files. Possibly will be added in the future.</li>
 </ul>

<h2 id="how_it_works">How it works</h2>

Most users will use Rainbow Gum through a logging facade such as SLF4J and the only interaction with
Rainbow Gum is configuration of output and formatting. Rainbow Gum provides three ways to configure
out of the box:

<ul>
  <li>Programmatic Java configuration using builders.</li>
  <li>Simple String key/value properties often derived from System properties / env variables</li>
  <li>Dependency driven configuration where including a jar as dependency changes behavior automatically</li>
</ul>

In practice many will use a mixture of all three styles. Rainbow Gum uses the Service Loader to load "default" configurations. 
Other than logger levels most configuration is simply choosing which jars to be included at runtime and providing some
simple properties.

<h3 id="simple_example">Simple Example using System properties</h3>

Assuming we have <a href="#installation">installed RainbowGum as a dependency</a> a simple configuration example using System Properties is below:

{@code
  java \
  -Dlogging.appender.console.encoder=pattern \ 
  -Dlogging.encoder.console.pattern="[%thread] %-5level %logger{15} - %msg%n" \
  -Dlogging.level.com.myapp=DEBUG \
  myapp.jar 
}

What happens with the above is Rainbow Gum will load its default Rainbow Gum via the service loader and use the properties to configure
its builders. Unfortunately System properties on the command line can be rather tedious but luckily you
can plugin in your own properties system easily.

<h2 id="architecture">Architecture</h2>

Rainbow Gum's design has many superficial similarties to Logback, Log4j2, and Reload4j in that
there are Appenders and Encoders as well as how log levels are inherited but most of Rainbow Gum's design
is <em>very different!</em>.

<p>
  The major key difference in Rainbow Gum is that once configured and initialized the logging system is locked in and
  cannot be changed. Certain parts of the system can be changed at runtime but require opt-in which includes changing
  levels of logger names.
</p>
<p>
  Another major difference is that Rainbow Gum is highly modularized, immutable and componentized. In other frameworks
  OOP inheritance is heavily abused and riddled with state management. Furthermore there are components that
  have too much responsibility which is the case with Appenders in Logback or "Managers" in Log4j2.
  Furthermore Rainbow Gum avoids reflection other than the Service Loader and follows the builder pattern
  extensively to separate configuration from immutable runtime components. Almost all components have
  a builder to programmatically configure and the builders can take flat string key values as configuration. 
</p>
<p>
  The results of the above choices make Rainbow Gum far lighter than logback, log4j2, and reload4j particularly
  in initialization time as well as security surface area.
</p>

<strong>The key components expressed in the flow of log events is as follows:</strong>
<ol>
<li>Logging Facade (SLF4J)</li>
<li>{@link io.jstach.rainbowgum.RainbowGum}</li>
<li>{@link io.jstach.rainbowgum.LogRouter}</li>
<li>{@link io.jstach.rainbowgum.LogPublisher}</li>
<li>{@link io.jstach.rainbowgum.LogAppender}</li>
<li>{@link io.jstach.rainbowgum.LogEncoder}</li>
<li>{@link io.jstach.rainbowgum.LogOutput}</li>
</ol>

In the next sections we will cover {@link io.jstach.rainbowgum.LevelResolver}, 
Publishers, Appenders, Outputs, and Encoders as they are the main points of interest in customizing and configuring.


<h2 id="router">Router</h2>

A Router has a {@link io.jstach.rainbowgum.LevelResolver} and a Publisher.
A Level Resolver takes a logger name and produces a {@link java.lang.System.Logger.Level level}.
The logging facade implementation than decides based on the level whether or not to construct an event.
It then passes the event to the router which in turn uses the publisher.

For those familiar with other logging frameworks 
<strong>Rainbow Gum has no actual concept of named "Loggers"</strong> but a route from a router is the closest analog.

<p>
  When configuring Rainbow Gum we configure logger names to levels which we call "routes". 
</p>

<h2 id="publishers">Publishers</h2>

A {@link io.jstach.rainbowgum.LogPublisher} basically schedules delivery of a {@link io.jstach.rainbowgum.LogEvent} to a group of 
Appenders. Publishers come in two types: synchronous and asynchronous. An appender should only
belong to one publisher. 

<h2 id="appenders">Appenders</h2>

An appender contains an {@linkplain io.jstach.rainbowgum.LogEncoder Encoder} and an {@link io.jstach.rainbowgum.LogOutput Output}.
Unlike other logging frameworks it is rare to have custom Appenders as most of the work is done by the encoder and output.

<h2 id="encoders">Encoders</h2>

Encoders encode an event into binary. Because most encoding is text based RainbowGum has the concept of 
{@link io.jstach.rainbowgum.LogFormatter} which can be turned into an Encoder. Log formatters
are the most common extension point. 

<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>


<h3 id="maven">Maven</h3>


<pre class="language-xml">
{@code
<properties>
    <rainbowgum.version>_VERSION_</rainbowgum.version>
</properties>
...
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.jstach.rainbowgum</groupId>
        <artifactId>rainbowgum</artifactId>
        <version>${rainbowgum.version}</version>
        <scope>runtime</scope>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
}
</pre>


If you plan on configuring Rainbow Gum programmatically you will need to make a module and create a
service loader registration. In that case you will want the dependency like:

<pre class="language-xml">
{@code
<properties>
    <rainbowgum.version>_VERSION_</rainbowgum.version>
</properties>
...
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.jstach.rainbowgum</groupId>
        <artifactId>rainbowgum-core</artifactId>
        <version>${rainbowgum.version}</version>
        <scope>compile</scope>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
}
</pre>

<h3 id="3.2">Gradle</h3>

<pre><code class="language-kotlin">
dependencies {
    
    runtimeOnly 'io.jstach.rainbowgum:rainbowgum:_VERSION_'
}
</code>
</pre>


If you plan on configuring Rainbow Gum programmatically you will need to make a module and create a
service loader registration. In that case you will want the dependency like:

<pre><code class="language-kotlin">
dependencies {
    
    implementation 'io.jstach.rainbowgum:rainbowgum-core:_VERSION_'
}
</code>
</pre>

<h2 id="configuration">Configuration</h2>

Most configuration of Rainbow Gum is done by adding extension jars as runtime dependencies
or by setting key values in {@linkplain io.jstach.rainbowgum.LogProperties properties}.

By default Rainbow Gum uses System properties for properties but a configuration system
can be used instead.

Logger levels and output can be configured through properties.

More information on builtin properties is in  {@link io.jstach.rainbowgum.LogProperties}.

IF you would like use your own properties system see {@link io.jstach.rainbowgum.spi.RainbowGumServiceProvider}.
